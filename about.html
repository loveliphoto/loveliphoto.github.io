				Looking back, itâ€™s funny to think about how many times our paths <i>could</i> have crossed before they actually did. We grew up fifteen minutes apart in Southeastern Wisconsin (if you're using your hand as a reference, it's near the bottom of your right thumb, palm up), we cruised around the same parts of town, hung out at the same ice cream shops, and even shared several mutual friends.<br><br>
				But, we were not fated to meet. Yet. Then, our freshman year at UW-Madison, [met in passing] we both attended the same church retreat. As luck would have it, we were even in the same small group of four people! We even posed for a picture together!<br><br>
				Nowadays, we're not only husband and wife, but also frisbee teammates, co-teachers, and, of course, best friends.
				After spending [two] years as teachers in Taipei, Taiwan, we are ready to make Madison, Wisconsin our home again.<br><br>
				Things we both love:<br><br>

			<p>About LOVE LI Photography
			<br><br>
			Betty bought her first "fancy" camera back in 2012 and hasn't put down the camera since. After the Li(ang) Wedding in October 2014, Ben began to join Betty on photoshoots as a proud second shooter. Ben and Betty have been dreaming about this future ever since. As we reflect on our marriage and the future of this passion project, the word we keep coming back to is "Love." Paired with our last name, Li, the name "LOVE LI PHOTOGRAPHY" perfectly captures the essence of who we are as a couple, and who we are as photographers.
