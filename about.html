			<h1>meet the Lis</h1>
			<p>
				Looking back, itâ€™s funny to think about how many times our paths <i>could</i> have crossed before they actually did. As high schoolers, we cruised around the same parts of town, haunted the same ice cream shops, and even shared several mutual friends.<br><br>
				But, we were not fated to meet. Yet. Then, our freshman year at UW-Madison, [met in passing] we both attended the same church retreat. As luck would have it, we were even in the same small group of four people! We even posed for a picture together!<br><br>
				Nowadays, we're not only husband and wife, but also frisbee teammates, co-teachers, and, of course, best friends.
